# qts_immortals

This is a collection of Jupyter notebook files used for the article "Daoist immortals as a poetic image in Tang dynasty: a corpus study."
It contains the following files:

- Collocations_immortals: code that was used to find collocates to _xian_ 仙 in QTS
- Patterns_immortals: code that was used to find lines similar to ones that used _xian_ 仙 in QTS and filter out those that have _xian_ substituted with something else
- 2-word_dic_QTS.txt: the file with tokenized QTS. 
- thesis_environment.yml: environment requirements to run the code. Since it was also used for other projects, it might contain more packages that were actually used for this project. 

For tokenization code, see https://github.com/mzorki/tutorials
The link above also contains a tutorial on how to run Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab without the need to install anything or extensive knowledge of programming – it can be followed to run the code from this repository as well.
