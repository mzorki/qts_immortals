# qts_immortals

This is a collection of Jupyter notebook files used for the article "Daoist immortals as a poetic image in Tang dynasty: a corpus study."
It contains the following files:

- Collocations_immortals: code that was used to find collocates to _xian_ 仙 in QTS
- Patterns: code that was used to find lines similar to ones that used _xian_ 仙 in QTS and filter out those that have _xian_ substituted with something else
- 2-word_dic_QTS.txt: the file with tokenized QTS. 

For tokenization code, see https://github.com/mzorki/tutorials
